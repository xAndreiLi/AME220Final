Attributes can be edited in JS by accessing it as a property of the element.
innerHTML is a property that refers to the content inside of the tag

declaration definition and invocation life cycle of functions
definition is also called assignment
why are they evevn discussing this
so far we have only looked at one statement
now we can group them under one function
add to the body onLoad=main

there is no entrypoint in javascript
it interperets one line at a time
this is a good example
this is how you define a function
function (name){(code block)}

javascript has to come after the tag that it is trying to access
document.write()
will overwrite the entire document
console.log() will write to the console but not the document
when writing a javascript program, you are writing a list of javascript
statements
there is only one type of container

strongly typed languages: c, java, c++
javascript is a loosely typed language
type refers to datatypes

strongly typed languages require that you declare the type of a variable
the data type of that variable cannot change afterwards

javascript is an interpreted language, and therefore, variables can change
types.

variables vs constants (literals)
variables hold data and can change
constants hold data and do not change

life cycle of a variable:
declaration, assignment/definition, usage

functions in javascript are variables
